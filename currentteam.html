		<p>The 2024–25 Premier League fixtures were released on 18 June 2024.[15] Manchester United opened their Premier League campaign on 16 August 2024 with a 1–0 win over Fulham. Substitute and debutant Joshua Zirkzee scored the only goal of the match in the 87th minute.[16] United then travelled to the Amex Stadium to take on Brighton & Hove Albion. Former United man Danny Welbeck opened the scoring in the 30th minute, capitalising on a defensive mistake. Amad Diallo then levelled the scores in the 61st minute, before United put the ball in the back of the net again through Alejandro Garnacho; however, replays showed that Zirkzee had accidentally tapped the ball into the net from an offside position while attempting to stand up, causing the goal to be ruled out. João Pedro then scored a late winner with an unmarked header at the backpost, condemning the Red Devils to a first league defeat of the season. United then hosted arch-rivals Liverpool at home; although United started well, Trent Alexander-Arnold had the ball in their net in the 8th minute, although the goal was ultimately ruled out for offside.
