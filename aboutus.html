		<p style="font-size:40px;" style="text-align:center;">We are a Glasgow based game development company called Higgy Piggy Games. At the start of our adventure we were just 3 people with a dream, Higgins, Fraser and Mcauley. Then we found this unemployed, brain rotten, bed ridden aussi who desperately needed help. He also had a skill that we needed so we took him in fixed him up gave him some money and he came up with the logo that is now Higgy Piggy Games.</p>
