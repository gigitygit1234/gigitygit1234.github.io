		<p style="font-size:40px;" style="text-align:center;">Piggy Hunting is a Higgy Piggy Games original creation. Piggy Hunting is currently on early access and the full game will be released in summer of 2025. Piggy Hunting is a realistic single player hunting game made by Higgy Piggy Games. Try and shoot the pigs down as they run across the screen. If you do, you get score points to upgrade your pig hunting weapons. The game is infinetly long, just like Piggy Clicker, so there are unlimited outcomes. The one problem is if 5 pigs pass you without felling the wrath of your piggy hunting weapons, you lose.
